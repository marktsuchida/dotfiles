" MacVim starts with 'macvim' color scheme, which is hard to read in dark
" mode.
" MacVim seems to set up color schemes after gvimrc is sourced, so just
" executing 'colorscheme default' here results in something different.
" See also :help macvim-colorscheme
" The following also works for non-mac.
" The colorscheme 'torte' is similar to 'default' but with a black background;
" it does not interfere with macOS dark mode.
autocmd GUIEnter * colorscheme torte
