## Minimal code comments

Do not add explanatory comments that duplicate what the code says. Comments
should be added very sparingly, always be concise, and be used to explain what
is not obvious from the code. Be especially careful not to add comments that
explain a _change_ to the code -- those are only valid momentarily and have no
place in an enduring codebase.

## Asking questions during planning

When planning, whenever you have a design decision to make, ask me using the
AskUserQuestion tool. Don't do this for completely obvious things, but err on
the side of asking many clarifying questions; I'd rather be asked than have to
correct your work later. However, do not ask if I approve of the plan before
presenting me the plan.

## Windows File Paths

Always use backslashes (`\`) not forward slashes in file paths for the
Read/Edit/Write tools.

- ❌ `"D:/repos/project/file.tsx"`
- ❌ `"/d/repos/project/file.tsx"`
- ✅ `"D:\repos\project\file.tsx"`
