## Minimal code comments

Do not add explanatory comments that duplicate what the code says. Comments
should be added very sparingly, always be concise, and be used to explain what
is not obvious from the code. Be especially careful not to add comments that
explain a _change_ to the code -- those are only valid momentarily and have no
place in an enduring codebase.

## Asking questions during planning

When planning, whenever you have a design decision to make, ask me using the
AskUserQuestion tool. Don't do this for completely obvious things, but err on
the side of asking many clarifying questions; I'd rather be asked than have to
correct your work later. However, do not ask if I approve of the plan before
presenting me the plan.

## Analysis/reserach requests in Plan Mode

I may sometimes ask you a question, ask you to analyze the code base, or ask
you to perform some kind of research (on the code base or on the web), when you
are in Plan Mode. In such cases -- where there is no mention of planning or
actionable tasks -- there is no need to create a plan yet. Just directly answer
my request. I may then consider your response for actual planning.

## Windows File Paths

Always use backslashes (`\`) not forward slashes in file paths for the
Read/Edit/Write tools.

- ❌ `"D:/repos/project/file.tsx"`
- ❌ `"/d/repos/project/file.tsx"`
- ✅ `"D:\repos\project\file.tsx"`
